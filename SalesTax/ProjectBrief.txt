The project has been designed keeping the use cases in mind i.e. The input will be a list of items with base prices and the 
output will be a list of items with appropriate taxes applied, and a summary of total sales tax and total Receipt cost.

Keeping the above in mind, the following object model was designed. 

The object model should work for above use case and should be easily extendible to more use cases.
The main idea is to divide responsibilities between classes and follow Single Responsibility Principle. This makes sure that
classes are not tightly coupled.  

In order to make sure the code does what it is supposed to do, thorough unit and integration testing has been performed.
In fact, there is more than 90% code coverage. 

Code Entry Point: ReceiptPrinter.java (under com.salestax.businesslogic) is meant to be the entry point for the program.
See com.salestax.businesslogic.ReceiptPrintTest for sample inputs to the code. Running ReceiptPrintTest.java should give an output 
in the console. 

==BusinessObjects==

Currency: To represent currencies like USD, CAD, etc.

ItemType: To represent different item types like Food item, Medicine, etc. This is used to keep track of the fact that some items are 
sales taxable and some are not.

ItemOrigin: To represent various kinds of origin ( Imported Vs Non Imported). This is used to keep track that which item origin is 
duty taxable and which is not.

Price: To represent a price like "10 USD". 

Item: To represent an item as it comes in a shop. For example, when an item arrives in a shop from a vendor, the following properties would be known
a. Its origin ( Imported vs non imported), b. Its type (Food, medicine, etc), c. Its price and d. its description
 
 
ItemReceiptEntry: To represent an entry in Receipt. For example "1 bottle of Perfume: 10.50". The idea is that ItemReceiptEntry contains
information about an Item and how much sales tax applies to it.

Receipt: A collection of ItemReceiptEntry objects.

==BusinessLogic==

TaxManager: This class is responsible to calculate the taxes applicable to an Item. 
It contains information about how much sales tax, import duty, etc is applicable and performs the logic of applying taxes to applicable Items.

ReceiptCalculator: This class is responsible calculating a 'Receipt'. It provides utility methods to take a list of Item as input 
and returns a Receipt object.

ReceiptPrinter: This class is responsible for providing a receipt String in the desired format. It uses ReceiptCalculator to be able to get a Receipt.


===Testing===
All the classes have been tested using JUnit and Mockito.   Unit tests are located under tst folder
Integration testing has also been performed. Integration Test is located under tst/IntegrationTest.java

Overall, I am confident that the code has more than 90% branch and line test coverage.
