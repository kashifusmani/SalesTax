Setup Via Eclipse is recommended because it is easy and painless.Note that these instructions are for Windows 64 Bit Eclipse Kepler 4.3. 
Other version may slightly vary.

1. Download Java 7 from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

2. Download Eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/download/

3. Once download is complete, unzip the file . Open the unzipped folder, open eclipse.exe

4. Now, download the code base from https://github.com/kashifusmani/SalesTax/ . Note that there is a 'Download ZIP' button 
to the lower right corner of the github page.

5. Once download is complete, extract the ZIP file at a location of your choice. The unzipped folder should be called 'SalesTax-master'. Within 
this folder there should be another folder called 'SalesTax-master' and with in this one there is folder called 'SalesTax'. 
This is where the code resides. Remember this location for step 7.

6. Now go back to Eclipse, click File -> New -> Project , and then select Java Project. Click Next. 

7. Uncheck 'Use default location', click on Browse button and navigate to folder SalesTax (from step 5) and click OK.

8. Eclipse should auto-populate the 'Project name:' and 'Location:' field. Click Next.

9. In the first tab  called 'Source', src, tst and lib folders (all these 3 reside under SalesTax folder) should be populated.  At the bottom of
this view, 'Default output folder:'  should be set to SalesTax/bin. 

10. Click on Third tab called 'Libraries'. It must be already populated with jars under SalesTax/lib folder. 
If not, click on 'Add External JARs...' button,navigate to SalesTax/lib and add commons-lang3-3.3.2.jar, junit-4.10.jar and mockito-all-1.9.5.jar. 
It should also be populated with JRE 7 system Library. If not, click 'Add Library' and add java library.

11. Click Finish. Open 'Package Explorer' view in Eclipse.
The src folder should not show any red marks (which indicates compiler errors). If it does, then one or 
more libraries mentioned in step 10 could be missing.  
 
12. Open tst/com/salestax/businesslogic/ReceiptPrintTest.java . Run it, you should see the output in the console.

13. If this set up does not work, feel free to reach out to me and I will help out to make the setup.
